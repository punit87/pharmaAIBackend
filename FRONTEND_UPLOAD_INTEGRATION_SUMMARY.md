# Frontend Upload Integration Summary

## Completed Integration

Successfully integrated document upload functionality into the Knowledge-base Management screen.

## Files Modified (Frontend)

### 1. `/knowledgebot/src/lib/knowledge-base.ts`
- Updated `getPresignedUploadUrl()` to call pharma backend API Gateway
- Added `triggerDocumentProcessing()` method for ECS /process endpoint

### 2. `/knowledgebot/src/pages/KnowledgeBaseManagement.tsx`
- Added upload state (`isUploading`, `uploadProgress`)
- Added `handleFileUpload()` handler
- Added upload button in header
- Added progress bar UI
- Added success/error message displays
- Added file input (hidden, accepts .pdf, .docx, .txt)

## How It Works

1. **User clicks "Upload Document" button**
2. **File selection dialog opens**
3. **File selected → upload starts**
   - Gets presigned URL from API Gateway (10% progress)
   - Uploads file to S3 with progress tracking (20-90%)
   - Triggers document processing on ECS (90-95%)
   - Shows success message (100%)
   - Reloads documents list

## API Endpoints Used

- **GET** `https://h51u75mco5.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/presigned-url`
  - Returns presigned S3 upload URL
  
- **POST** `http://pharma-rag-alb-dev-2054947644.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com/process`
  - Triggers document processing (bucket, key parameters)

## Backend Status

✅ API Gateway endpoint exists (`/presigned-url`)
✅ Lambda function (`presigned_url.py`) ready
✅ S3 bucket configured
✅ Document processor Lambda ready
✅ ECS /process endpoint ready
✅ CORS headers configured

## Frontend Changes Required

The frontend files have been modified and need to be committed:

```bash
cd /Users/bejoypramanick/iCloud\ Drive\ \(Archive\)\ -\ 1/Desktop/globistaan/projects/chatbot/knowledgebot

# Review changes
git status

# Stage files
git add src/lib/knowledge-base.ts
git add src/pages/KnowledgeBaseManagement.tsx

# Commit
git commit -m "feat: integrate document upload with pharma backend

- Connect upload to API Gateway /presigned-url endpoint
- Add S3 direct upload with progress tracking
- Add document processing trigger
- Add upload button, progress bar, and feedback
- Auto-reload documents list after upload"

# Push
git push origin main
```

## Testing

1. Start frontend: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to Knowledge-base Management
3. Click "Upload Document"
4. Select a file (PDF, DOCX, or TXT)
5. Watch progress bar
6. See success message
7. Verify document in list

## Environment Variables Needed

Add to frontend `.env`:
```
VITE_PHARMA_API_URL=https://h51u75mco5.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev
VITE_PHARMA_ALB_URL=http://pharma-rag-alb-dev-2054947644.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com
```

## What Happens After Upload

1. File uploaded to S3
2. S3 triggers Lambda (`document_processor`)
3. Lambda calls ECS `/process` endpoint
4. Document parsed with Docling
5. Content chunked and inserted into LightRAG
6. Document ready for RAG queries
